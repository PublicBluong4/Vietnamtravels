				<h1>PLACES</h1>
				<p>Here at Rough Guides we’ve always known that Vietnam is magical. The gleaming skyscrapers of the country’s booming cities have a singular kind of beauty that shouldn’t be overlooked, but it’s the natural landscape that is truly breathtaking. Picture rice terraces carved into steep hillsides, market days that are a riot of colour, limestone peaks jutting out from azure waters and white-sand beaches stretching for miles. Here are the most beautiful places in Vietnam – as voted for by our readers</p>

				<h1>TRADITIONAL FOODS</h1>
				<p>Where some countries may be known for innovative new dishes and modern culinary skills, Vietnam is best known for its age-old recipes, from warming noodle soup to Franco-Vietnamese bánh mì baguettes. Here are the 10 best traditional Vietnamese dishes that make it deliciously obvious why they’ve stood the test of time.</p>

				<h1>COFFEE</h1>
				<p>Strong and flavourful Vietnamese coffee makes converts as quickly as it raises pulses. French colonists might have introduced coffee to Vietnam, but the morning cup of ca phe soon became a local habit. With variations that make use of yoghurt, eggs and even fruit, Vietnamese coffee has developed a style of its own.</p>

				<h1>TRAVELS</h1>
				<p>While it isn’t my favorite country in the world, there’s no denying that backpacking Vietnam (or simply just traveling here on a budget) is an experience filled with natural beauty and delicious food! From the natural beauty of Sam Mountain and Halong Bay to the man-made artistry of the sacred temples and pagodas to the rice terraces and beaches, Vietnam has a lot to offer travelers.</p>
